        <h4>Unstuffed Peppers Prepare in a Skillet</h4>
        <p>This is similar to a stuffed pepper dish, without the work of stuffing the peppers.
            It packs just as much flavor and is delicious.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>8 ounces mini sweet peppers, sliced crosswise</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground sirloin (90/10)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons hot cherry pepper hoagie spread (such as Cento)</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 (8.8 ounce) package microwavable white rice (such as Uncle Ben’s), crumbled</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>Step 1</h5>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with garlic and Italian seasoning and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, water, hoagie spread, and salt.</li>
            <li><h5>Step 2</h5>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in rice until coated evenly with sauce. Cover, reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer, and cook until rice and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes, stirring once halfway through to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><h5>Step 3</h5>Uncover, remove from heat, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Re-cover and let sit until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot sprinkled with basil or parsley.</li>
        </ul>
